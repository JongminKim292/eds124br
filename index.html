            <h2>About me</h2>    
        <p>When trying to solve problems, I like to look at them from various perspectives. Some people criticize this as being inefficient, and indeed, in terms of producing results quickly, this way of solving problems is of course inefficient. Sometimes my approach takes a lot of time, and this can have drawbacks at times. However, I believe this approach has a creative component, especially in the academic perspective.</p>
        <p>Above all, to think from various perspectives is, for me, more interesting and enjoyable. When trying to truly understand a problem or a question, I believe tackling that question from many angles is the best way. This perspective has helped me to develop my academic creativity, and has also firmly established my background in mathematical algorithms. For example, when solving a math problem, or proving a theorem, I do not try to look up the explanation in textbooks in advance.</p>
        <p>Instead, I try to find my own ways of solving the problem at least two or three and then compare my approaches with the textbook. This attitude, especially towards matters of logical thinking, can develop one's creative abilities. In addition, I have been able to apply my creative side in my workplace. Currently I'm working at the learning assistance center at my current college as a tutor. In that setting, there were often times when students could not understand the concepts in the way the textbooks introduced them. So, when I help other students, I try to introduce a different approach in order to solve the problems in different ways. This has helped them not only understand the textbook's approach, but also to develop their own creative problem-solving skills. In my workplace, I don't think it's always me giving them help; my students have given me different approaches that I had not considered before. This excites me, since I like thinking in different ways. If they offer different approaches from mine, we usually analyze them together and find out how we found these approaches. I believe this method of problem solving has boosted my creativity, and has provided a benefit in my life.</p>
